# Technical Challenge: Real-Time Soft Body Dynamics
Soft body dynamics require complex calculations to simulate the physical properties and interac-
tions of deformable objects. These calculations are computationally intensive and can significantly
impact the performance of a game, particularly in terms of CPU and memory usage. As the number
of soft bodies in a scene increases, the computational load grows, leading to potential performance
bottlenecks that can affect the gameâ€™s frame rate and overall responsiveness.

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and optimize the performance of real-time soft body
dynamics in a game setting. This involves measuring the CPU and memory usage under various
conditions, including different numbers and resolutions of soft bodies, as well as their interactions
with rigid bodies. By understanding the performance implications of these factors, we can develop
strategies to optimize the simulation, ensuring that the game runs smoothly even with complex soft
body dynamics.
